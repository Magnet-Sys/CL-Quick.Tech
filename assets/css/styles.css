/* 
A sticky footer always stays on the bottom of the page regardless of how little content 
is on the page. However, this footer will be pushed down if there is a lot of content, 
so it is different from a fixed footer. Add the following code to your CSS file.
Note: This may cause issues in Internet Explorer which has weak support for flexbox. */

body {
  display: flex;
  min-height: 100vh;
  flex-direction: column;
